const haiku_preset = `Haiku about a pond:
An old silent pond
A frog jumps into the pond—
Splash! Silence again.

Haiku about candle:
The light of a candle
Is transferred to another candle—
Spring twilight

Haiku about poppy:
I write, erase, rewrite
Erase again, and then
A poppy blooms.

Haiku about wintry:
Over the wintry
Forest, winds howl in rage
With no leaves to blow.

Haiku about love:
love between us is
speech and breath. loving you is
a long river running.
